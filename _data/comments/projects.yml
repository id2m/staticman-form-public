    I’m a big fan of static site generators. I’ve used Jekyll to power numerous websites, including this one. But despite the clear advantages static sites can have over their database-driven, dynamic counterparts, it didn’t take long for me to feel a paradigmatic pain point: if there is no back-end to receive and process forms with user input, how can I add user-generated content? To address that, I built Staticman, a service that receives, processes and transforms content into data files, pushed to a GitHub repository where the rest of your content lives. Staticman creates a pull request whenever an entry is submitted: merge it to accept the submission, or close it to send it away.

    I’m very interested in web performance. Making sure websites load and become responsive as quickly as possible is a determinant factor in user experience, engagement and even revenue. As a developer, this is something that I take into consideration at all times when working on a project, but I feel it’s equally important that performance data can be something that everyone in a team or organisation, regardless of their technical background, can access and act upon. SpeedTracker is a service that constantly monitors various performance metrics of a website and displays them in an easy-to-consume dashboard, allowing people to quickly assess how new features or infrastructural changes have impacted the perceived performance for users across the world.
